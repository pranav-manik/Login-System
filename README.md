# Login System

This is a Login System based off of my previous app (AuthApp)using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and JQuery one that could in real time display login errors
to the client rather than loading new pages, a Login system that was secure and would save user sessions
## Run
```
npm start
```
## Get Dependencies
```
npm install package.json
```
